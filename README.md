Web-based ecommerce clothing store that allows users to filter and sort products by size, color, and price, add products to their cart and wishlist, and purchase the products in their cart using stripe checkout. The technologies I used to build this application are React, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redux, JWT, and Stripe API. Link to website:  Link: https://tubular-tulumba-85d1d0.netlify.app/.
